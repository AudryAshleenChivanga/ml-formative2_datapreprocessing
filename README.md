## Setup & Execution
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Running the Notebooks
1. Navigate to the `notebook/` folder.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks using:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run `task_2_merge.ipynb` to merge datasets.
4. Run `feature_engineering.ipynb` to generate engineered features.
